        <h1>Description of Mechatronics</h1>
        <a href="index.html" title="home"><img src="2.jpg" alt="mechatronics"></a>
        <p> As technology advances over time, various subfields of engineering have succeeded in both adapting and multiplying. The intention of mechatronics is to produce a design solution that unifies each of these various subfields. Originally, the field of mechatronics was intended to be nothing more than a combination of mechanics and electronics, hence the name being a portmanteau of <b>mecha</b>nics and elec<b>tronics</b>; however, as the complexity of technical systems continued to evolve, the definition had been broadened to include more technical areas.</p>
        <p>A mechatronics engineer unites the principles of mechanics, electronics, and computing to generate a simpler, more economical and reliable system. The term "mechatronics" was coined by <i>Tetsuro Mori</i>, the senior engineer of the Japanese company Yaskawa in 1969.</p>
